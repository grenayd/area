          @CWelcome to Lasertag.
          
  @DIn this text game, you must @GMOVE@D around and attempt to @GSHOOT@D
an automaton called a @GLASERBOT@D.

  You may @GMOVE@D by typing @GNORTH@D, @GEAST@D, @GSOUTH@D, or @GWEST@D,
but you may omit any amount of trailing letters as long as your command
does not clash with another.

  To @GSHOOT@D, you will type @GSHOOT <DIRECTION>@D. A direction may be any
compass direction or its first letter. Note that as you can abbreviate
@C"shoot"@D, you may not abbreviate it to @C"s"@D as it will instead move
you south. The recommended abbreviation is @C"sh"@D. (See @GHELP SHOOTING
@Dfor more details)

  @GSHOOT@Ding will send a pulse of energy in the direction specified. If the
pulse enters a room another character is in, the other character will be
@GHIT@D. This results in the character being placed in a random room in the
@GMAZE@D.

  Finally, you may @GSCAN@D your surroundings by typing just that.

  @WGood luck; the bot moves fast.@D
