To shoot in this game, you use the @GSHOOT@D command and a direction such as
@GN@D or @GEAST@D. Your gun will fire a pulse of energy in the direction
specified, which will die if it passes through more than three rooms. If your
shot passes through a room with another character (e.g. the @GLASERBOT@D),
there is a chance it will hit it and place it in a random room. You will
gain 10 points for each hit, but lose 5 points for each hit on you.

You only have 6 shots. If you run out of shots, you must go back to the @GBASE@D
(the room you started in) and @GRECHARGE@D (see @GHELP RECHARGE@D)

(Hint: Instead of typing @GSHOOT EAST@D, you can type @GSH E@D)

and @GHELP HUNT@D)
