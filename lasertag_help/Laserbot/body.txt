Your nemesis in this game is an automaton called the @GLASERBOT@D. Here is how
it plays:

  1. either:
      @GHUNT@D player and move in direction
     or:
      move in random direction
    
  2. scan
  
  3. if player is one room away, shoot at player.
  
  4. if out of shots, run back to base and @GRECHARGE@D
  
  
  
  (If a word is marked in @GGREEN@D, you can type @GHELP <THAT WORD>@D to
  see more information about it.)
