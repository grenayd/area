This game will draw a map for (almost) every room. Here is an
example:  

     In the Lasertag Arena
     
     
     
     
     
     
        (YOU ARE HERE)
                   |
              -----V-----
             |[ ] .#. . .|
              ---        |
                 |. .|. .|
                 |   |   |
                 |. .|. .|
                 |
                 |. . . . . .|
                  -----------

     You can go east, south, or west.
     
The # represents you.

Walls are | and ---. The two characters in a room are the terrain.
There are many terrains. For example, in this map, "[ ]" means "inside"
and ". ." means you are in a city or a road.

To fully understand the map, you must move around. (@GHELP MOVEMENT@D)
